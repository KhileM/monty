C - Stacks and Queues are fundamental data structures used in computer science and programming to manage collections of elements. They serve different purposes and follow different principles of operation.

A stack is an abstract data type that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It resembles a stack of objects in real life, where the last item placed on top is the first one to be removed. In a stack, elements are added or removed only from one end called the "top." This behavior is often referred to as "push" for adding an element to the top and "pop" for removing the topmost element. Stacks can be visualized as a vertical structure where elements are stacked on top of each other. The stack data structure is commonly used in scenarios such as function calls, expression evaluation, and undo-redo mechanisms.

A queue, on the other hand, is an abstract data type that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It behaves like a real-life queue or line of people waiting for a service. The first person who enters the queue is the first one to leave. In a queue, elements are added at one end called the "rear" and removed from the other end called the "front." This structure is often referred to as "enqueue" for adding an element to the rear and "dequeue" for removing an element from the front. Queues can be visualized as a horizontal structure where elements are arranged in a sequential order. Queues are commonly used in scenarios such as job scheduling, handling requests, and breadth-first search algorithms.

In summary, stacks follow the LIFO principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. Queues follow the FIFO principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed. Stacks are useful for managing function calls, expression evaluation, and undo-redo operations. Queues are useful for managing job scheduling, handling requests, and implementing breadth-first search algorithms.
